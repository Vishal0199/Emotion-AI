# Facial-Keypoint-Detection-and-Facial-Emotion-Recognition
- Emotion AI is a branch of AI that allow computers to understand human non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions.
- The aim of this project is to predict the facial keypoint of face image and also classify people's emotions based on their face images.
# Part 1: KEY FACIAL POINTS DETECTION
- Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/overview
- In part 1 I have created a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and residual Blocks to predict facial key-points
- The dataset consists of x and y coordinates of 15 facial key points.
- Input images are 96X96 pixels.
- Images consist of only one color channel(grat-scale images)
